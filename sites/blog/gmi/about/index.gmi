# About Me

=> /siva.jpg Siva Mahadevan

I'm an open source developer, digital minimalist, and plaintext nerd. Right now, I'm primarily contributing to these projects actively:

=> https://codeberg.org/svmhdvn/empt/ EMPT
=> https://www.freebsd.org/ FreeBSD
=> https://alpinelinux.org/ Alpine Linux

These are a few projects, other than the ones above, that have inspired me. Given enough time and financial stability, I would love to spend more time contributing to them.

=> https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/ The BQN Array Programming Language
=> https://t2sde.org/ T2 System Development Environment
=> https://www.scryer.pl/ Scryer Prolog

All of my work is free and open source. You can follow me at these places:
